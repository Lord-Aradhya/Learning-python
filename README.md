# Non-Invasive Biosensing Project Overview

Welcome to our Non-Invasive Biosensing Project! Under the guidance of Dr. Pydi Ganga Bahubaldruni & Dr. Sweta Lal, we are developing an innovative health monitoring application. This app aims to provide users with accurate estimations of their biomarker levels using a non-invasive method.

## How Does It Work?
Our approach involves a specially designed reagent-coated filter paper. Users simply place a sample of their biomarker—such as sweat—on this paper. The reagent reacts with the sample, changing color based on the biomarker's composition. By analyzing the color intensity, we can determine whether the user's health metrics fall within an optimal range or if medical intervention might be necessary.

## Project Status
Currently, our project is in the early stages of development. We are actively exploring and resolving various challenges as we progress.

## Repository Contents: OpenCV Projects
This repository contains initial code experiments related to image processing, crucial for analyzing the reagent's color change. Below are brief descriptions of the Python programs included:

1. **main1.py**: 
   - **Purpose**: My first attempt at capturing and processing an image using Matplotlib to understand its color scales.
   - **Features**: Basic image capture and color analysis.

2. **main2.py**: 
   - **Goal**: To refine image capture, focusing specifically on the filter paper's region where the color change occurs.
   - **Current State**: The program effectively identifies regions within the blue color spectrum, but further calibration is needed for enhanced accuracy.

Your contributions and feedback are greatly appreciated as we advance this exciting venture in health technology!
